//! `para.p2p` — the peer-to-peer / local-first stack, extracted from `std` into the first-party
//! **non-default** `para` namespace (the para-namespace arc, Slice 2).
//!
//! Three modules, all rooted at `para`:
//!   * `para.crdt`   — state-based CRDT value types (`GCounter`/`PnCounter`/`GSet`), pure Rust.
//!   * `para.p2p`    — `publish`/`receive`/`identity` over the `P2p` host capability.
//!   * `para.synced` — `synced_signal(...)`, a CRDT-backed signal that is a node in the *same*
//!     reactive graph as core `std.reactive` (it reaches the graph through noeta-stdlib's reactive
//!     seam; see [`synced`]).
//!
//! This crate is compiled and linked only when a program depends on the `para-p2p` package — it is
//! never part of a default (std-only) build. It is registered through the fixed native-extension
//! convention: the package's native entry crate re-exports [`NOETA_EXTENSIONS`], which the composed
//! toolchain aggregates and installs. The heavy p2panda transport stays in `noeta-host-real` behind
//! the `ring-p2p` feature (the `p2p`/`synced` modules keep `ring: Some("ring-p2p")`), reached via
//! the `P2p` host capability, so a program that never imports `para.p2p`/`para.synced` still sheds
//! the whole iroh/QUIC tree from its shipped binary.
