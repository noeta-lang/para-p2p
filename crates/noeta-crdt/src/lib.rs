//! The CRDT convergence core (p2p P0) — the **data-convergence** layer of the local-first stack
//! (architecture §9.15), split cleanly from the networking layer it will one day pair with.
//!
//! # What lives here (and what does not)
//!
//! This crate owns the **oracle-critical** half of collaborative state and nothing else: the
//! *merge algebra* over replica state. It is **state-based** (a CvRDT / convergent
//! replicated data type): each value carries its whole state, and [`Mergeable::merge`] computes
//! the least upper bound of two states. The three laws every implementation here upholds —
//!
//! 1. **commutativity** — `a.merge(b) == b.merge(a)`,
//! 2. **associativity** — `(a.merge(b)).merge(c) == a.merge(b.merge(c))`, and
//! 3. **idempotence** — `a.merge(a) == a`
//!
//! — are exactly what let independent replicas converge to the same value *without coordination*,
//! regardless of the order or duplication of the updates they exchange. The crate's tests exercise
//! all three (example-based and property-based) over every type.
//!
//! Like [`noeta-reactive`](../noeta_reactive/index.html), this crate is **dependency-free**,
//! `unsafe`-free, holds **no language values**, and does **no I/O**. The `para.crdt` module in
//! `noeta-para-p2p` wraps these types as extern values and both backends run this identical code, so
//! the differential oracle holds by construction — the same guarantee reactivity's shared graph has.
//!
//! The types come in two families. [`GCounter`], [`PnCounter`] and [`GSet`] hold **their own**
//! primitive state — a count, a member string — and the lattice is the whole type. [`LwwRegister`]
//! and [`OrSet`] hold what the *application* put in them, so they are generic over the value and the
//! surface instantiates them at [`CrdtValue`]: owned, ordered, serializable data. That is a value
//! *domain*, not a language handle — the "holds no language values" rule above is unchanged, and it
//! is not a limitation imported from the extern seam but the shape of the problem, since a value
//! with no wire encoding could not reach a peer no matter how it were stored.
//!
//! # Two determinism disciplines (the differential's proof obligations)
//!
//! 1. **Explicit replica identity.** A counter's state is keyed by a **replica id** — a string the
//!    caller supplies (`counter.increment("A", 1)`). In P0 there is no network and no node identity
//!    capability, so identity is explicit and deterministic; a real node's persisted Ed25519 id
//!    (§9.15.1) becomes the source of that string in a later slice, changing nothing here.
//! 2. **Ordered state.** Every collection is a [`BTreeMap`]/[`BTreeSet`], never a hash map: merge,
//!    equality, and display must be independent of iteration order, and hash-order would make the
//!    differential (and equality itself) nondeterministic.
//!
//! # Value semantics
//!
//! Every type is an **immutable value**: an update (`increment`, `insert`) returns a *new* state
//! rather than mutating in place, matching the language's value semantics and making purity
//! self-evident. This is why a CRDT can be a plain `Send` extern value with content equality — the
//! whole state is in the value, so copies are independent and `a.merge(b)` never touches `a` or `b`.
